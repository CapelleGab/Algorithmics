# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains several classic and varied sorting algorithms.  
Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science that consists of rearranging a list or array of elements in a defined order (usually ascending).

## Included Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort**
  A simple and educational algorithm, but inefficient on large lists (O(nÂ²) complexity).

  [Python](./bubble_sort/python/bubble_sort.py), [TypeScript](./bubble_sort/typescript/bubble_sort.ts), [Java](./bubble_sort/java/bubble_sort.java), [PHP](./bubble_sort/php/bubble_sort.php)

- **Insertion Sort**  
  Builds the sorted list incrementally by inserting elements in their correct place.

- **Gnome Sort**  
  An intuitive variant of insertion sort based on successive swaps.

- **Heap Sort**  
  Uses a data structure called heap to sort in O(n log n).

- **Merge Sort**  
  An efficient "divide and conquer" algorithm with O(n log n) complexity.

- **Quick Sort**  
  Very performant in practice, also based on divide and conquer.

- **Shell Sort**  
  An improvement over insertion sort using gaps to reduce exchanges.

- **Selection Sort**  
  Scans the list to select the minimum element and places it in the correct position.

Each algorithm is implemented in multiple programming languages, with its own unit tests to ensure reliability.
