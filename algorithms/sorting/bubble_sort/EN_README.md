# Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is one of the simplest and most educational sorting algorithms.  
It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order, until the list is sorted.

---

## How it works

- Traverse the list from start to end
- Compare each pair of adjacent elements
- Swap the elements if the first is greater than the second
- Repeat until no swaps are needed

---

## Complexity

- Time: O(nÂ²) in the worst and average cases
- Space: O(1) (in-place sorting)

---

## Usage

Bubble Sort is mainly used for educational purposes because it is easy to understand but inefficient on large datasets.
